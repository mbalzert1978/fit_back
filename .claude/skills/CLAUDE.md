# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this repo is

A collection of **Claude Code agent skills**. Each skill is a directory whose name is the skill's kebab-case name, containing a `SKILL.md`. There is no build, lint, or test step — skills are markdown documents loaded by the Claude Code harness, so "running" a skill means invoking it inside Claude Code, not executing a command here.

The skills live directly in `.claude/skills/` so this repo **loads its own skills as project skills** — you can dogfood them while working here. Claude Code discovers project skills only at `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (the `skills/` segment is required — a skill placed directly in `.claude/<name>/` will *not* load). After adding, moving, or renaming a skill, run `/reload-skills`; then invoke it with `/<skill-name>` (e.g. `/skill-audit`, `/skill-tune-up`).

Skills are grouped into the four buckets (see Design Contract below). Current inventory by bucket:

**Utility** — one small reusable thing, the same way every time:

- `apply-validator-findings` — takes the findings already produced by a set of quality validators and fixes every one, applying each finding's own located remedy — never re-reviewing or inventing new scope.
- `build-verifier` — scaffolds a new Verification-bucket skill from a description; fills a bundled `assets/` template.
- `compress-prompt` — rewrites a prompt or text to use fewer tokens while preserving intent, applying a fixed set of token-reduction techniques and reporting a before/after token estimate.
- `fixer-alternative-classes-with-different-interfaces` — aligns two classes doing the same job under different method names/signatures — Rename Method/Extract Superclass — paired with `verifier-alternative-classes-with-different-interfaces`.
- `fixer-comments` — replaces a WHAT-comment with a name that carries the meaning (Extract Method/Rename/Introduce Assertion), leaving genuine WHY comments untouched — paired with `verifier-comments`.
- `fixer-data-class` — moves behavior into an anemic Domain type (Move Method/Encapsulate Field/Collection) — paired with `verifier-data-class`.
- `fixer-data-clumps` — extracts a recurring group of variables/parameters into its own Value Object/class (Extract Class + Introduce Parameter Object) — paired with `verifier-data-clumps`.
- `fixer-dead-code` — deletes a variable/parameter/field/method/class with zero remaining references — paired with `verifier-dead-code`.
- `fixer-divergent-change` — splits a class that changes for many unrelated reasons into one class per concern (Extract Class/Superclass/Subclass) — paired with `verifier-divergent-change`.
- `fixer-duplicate-code` — replaces near-identical copy-pasted fragments with one shared implementation (Extract Method/Class, Substitute Algorithm) — paired with `verifier-duplicate-code`.
- `fixer-feature-envy` — moves a method to the class whose data it actually operates on (Move Method) — paired with `verifier-feature-envy`.
- `fixer-inappropriate-intimacy` — separates two classes reaching into each other's internals (Hide Delegate/Move Method/Change Bidirectional Association) — paired with `verifier-inappropriate-intimacy`.
- `fixer-incomplete-library-class` — centralizes a scattered library/framework-gap workaround (Introduce Foreign Method/Local Extension) — paired with `verifier-incomplete-library-class`.
- `fixer-large-class` — splits a class whose fields/methods cluster into more than one natural group (Extract Class/Subclass/Interface) — paired with `verifier-large-class`.
- `fixer-lazy-class` — inlines or collapses a class that no longer earns its own existence (Inline Class/Collapse Hierarchy) — paired with `verifier-lazy-class`.
- `fixer-long-method` — extracts cohesive pieces out of a method mixing several responsibilities/abstraction levels (Extract Method, Decompose Conditional, Replace Method with Method Object) — paired with `verifier-long-method`.
- `fixer-long-parameter-list` — collapses excess parameters into an object or a derivable lookup (Introduce Parameter Object/Preserve Whole Object) — paired with `verifier-long-parameter-list`.
- `fixer-message-chains` — hides a navigation chain behind a method on the object the client already holds (Hide Delegate) — paired with `verifier-message-chains`.
- `fixer-middle-man` — removes a class whose methods do nothing but forward to another class (Remove Middle Man), preserving intentional port/adapter seams — paired with `verifier-middle-man`.
- `fixer-parallel-inheritance-hierarchies` — merges two hierarchies extended in lockstep into one (Move Method/Field) — paired with `verifier-parallel-inheritance-hierarchies`.
- `fixer-primitive-obsession` — replaces a raw primitive standing in for a domain concept with a Value Object/typed class (Replace Data Value with Object, Replace Type Code) — paired with `verifier-primitive-obsession`.
- `fixer-refused-bequest` — replaces an ill-fitting inheritance relationship with delegation or a narrower base (Replace Inheritance with Delegation, Extract Superclass) — paired with `verifier-refused-bequest`.
- `fixer-shotgun-surgery` — consolidates one conceptual change scattered across many files into a single place (Move Method/Field, Inline Class) — paired with `verifier-shotgun-surgery`.
- `fixer-speculative-generality` — removes an unused just-in-case abstraction (Inline Method/Class, Collapse Hierarchy) — paired with `verifier-speculative-generality`.
- `fixer-switch-statements` — moves a discriminant switched on in several places onto the type/closed DU's cases (Replace Type Code with Subclasses/State-Strategy) — paired with `verifier-switch-statements`.
- `fixer-temporary-field` — extracts a field only meaningful during one algorithm into its own object (Extract Class, Replace Method with Method Object) — paired with `verifier-temporary-field`.
- `handoff` — compacts the current conversation into a handoff document for another agent.
- `issue-close` — closes one issue — sets status: closed in its frontmatter and appends a completion note to the issue file's own body, no central progress file involved.
- `issue-status` — scans docs/issues/ for frontmatter status fields and prints a grouped status table (blocked / open / closed / …) to chat — read-only, no files written.
- `refine-prompt` — improves/hardens a draft prompt or task template and returns the rewritten text + a changelog — never executing what the prompt asks.
- `reflect` — end-of-session experience extraction; persists structured experience files with decay metadata.
- `run-tests` — runs the project's test suite via the one canonical invocation (plain dotnet test from the repo root) and surfaces the pass/fail result.
- `strategic-compact` — suggests manual context compaction at logical intervals to preserve context.
- `sync-skill-index` — regenerates the skill-inventory region of CLAUDE.md from the filesystem + a bucket map.
- `to-prd` — converts current conversation context into a PRD and publishes it to the issue tracker.
- `verbessere-text` — improves a short text or keywords into three tone variants (AskUserQuestion pick, source language kept), normalized dash-free by a bundled `scripts/strip_dashes.py`.
- `worktree-entfernen` — tears down a worktree only when it is final in main (branch merged) and its tree is clean — junction-safe removal, deletes the merged branch; `--force` to override.
- `worktree-erstellen` — creates a git worktree under `.claude/worktrees/` and makes the local-only context (`.claude/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CONTEXT.md`) available inside it — platform-appropriate symlink/junction/hardlink, idempotent.

**Verification** — checks the quality of a final output:

- `architecture-adr-check` — checks code changes against this repo's architecture-decision docs and the issue they implement (paths via `config.json`, missing config = `CONFIG ERROR` not a silent pass) — invariants honored, acceptance criteria met — returning PASS/FAIL plus a `Findings: <n>` count.
- `design-pattern-fit-check` — reviews a diff for shapeless/procedural code where a named GoF/architectural pattern (Strategy, State, Factory, Builder, Decorator, Observer, Command, Chain of Responsibility, Template Method, Adapter, Repository) would express it more cleanly — requires naming the concrete pattern and sketching the seams, not just "add an abstraction" — returning BLOCK/APPROVE plus a `Findings: <n>` count.
- `docs-code-consistency` — checks docs (docstrings, README, docs/ADRs/CONTEXT.md) against the current code and returns PASS/FAIL plus an itemized, located drift report — checker, not fixer.
- `illegal-state-check` — reviews a diff's data/type model for representable-but-invalid states — a flag/enum plus optional fields only valid in some combinations, an unconstrained primitive standing in for a constrained domain, a mutable object with violable invariants — and pushes to make the bad state unrepresentable, not merely checked. Returns BLOCK/APPROVE plus a `Findings: <n>` count.
- `improve-codebase-architecture` — reviews a codebase for deepening opportunities (shallow modules worth collapsing).
- `language-idiom-check` — reviews a diff for missed idioms of the language actually in use (pattern matching, records, collection pipelines, destructuring, ...) and for imperative code that should be declarative (pattern matching over cascades, immutable values, pure functions). Returns BLOCK/APPROVE plus a `Findings: <n>` count.
- `lint-and-format-check` — runs this repo's configured `linter`/`formatter` (command + args from `config.json`, any language) — unconfigured proposes a pair by detected language and stops as `CONFIG ERROR` rather than guessing — returning PASS/FAIL plus a `Findings: <n>` count.
- `propose-skills` — scans chat history for repeated manual tasks that should be skills and proposes each (name, bucket, one job), skipping what existing skills cover.
- `qa-check` — runs the test suite via `run-tests`, and — toggleable via `config.json` — flags changed production units whose configured test location didn't change alongside them; the unit→test-location map is an ordered rule list in `config.json`, never assumed. Slice *shape* is `slice-shape-check`'s job, not this one's.
- `review-against-rules` — reviews a diff/branch against this repo's configured coding-standard dirs and, if configured, a reference implementation, via the `senior-code-reviewer` subagent — required config missing = `CONFIG ERROR` not a silent pass — returning BLOCK/APPROVE plus a `Findings: <n>` count.
- `skill-audit` — flags existing skills that straddle more than one bucket and recommends a split or trim.
- `skill-tune-up` — audits skills against the five structural levers; flags mechanical weaknesses.
- `slice-shape-check` — checks the mechanically-verifiable half of this repo's feature-slice form — every use-case package carries its Test-API and fakes, and no spec reaches past the Test-API into domain/handler/mappers/fakes/infrastructure. Structure only, no code judgment; missing config = `CONFIG ERROR` not a silent pass. Returns BLOCK/APPROVE plus a `Findings: <n>` count.
- `solid-principles-check` — reviews a diff against the five SOLID principles (SRP/OCP/LSP/ISP/DIP), each with its own smell checklist, plus a mechanical file-size pre-check (oversized files are a classic SRP smell). Returns BLOCK/APPROVE plus a `Findings: <n>` count.
- `structure-placement-check` — flags changed test files living outside the configured test-root prefixes — a purely mechanical file-*path* check, no code content read; missing config = `CONFIG ERROR` not a silent pass. The cheap, objective first gate before any content-level review. Returns BLOCK/APPROVE plus a `Findings: <n>` count.
- `thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review` — extremely strict, language-agnostic, deliberately open-ended maintainability review — abstraction quality, spaghetti conditions, canonical-layer reuse, orchestration atomicity. Standalone/manual use only ("tear this PR apart") — its open-ended bar has no fixed point, so it is not part of `validate-fix-loop`'s default validator set; see `solid-principles-check`/`design-pattern-fit-check`/`language-idiom-check`/`illegal-state-check` for the bounded, loop-safe split of its rubric.
- `token-budget-audit` — audits persistent-context artifacts (CLAUDE.md, SKILL.md files, memory) against token-budget heuristics and returns PASS/FAIL plus a located, itemized report.
- `verifier-alternative-classes-with-different-interfaces` — reviews a diff for two classes performing the same job under different method names/signatures, blocking interchangeable use. Returns BLOCK/APPROVE plus a `Findings: <n>` count.
- `verifier-audit` — flags skills that should become verifiers or gain an objective Pass/Fail or grade-out-of-10 check.
- `verifier-comments` — reviews a diff for comments explaining WHAT unclear code does instead of a genuinely non-obvious WHY. Returns BLOCK/APPROVE plus a `Findings: <n>` count.
- `verifier-data-class` — reviews a diff for anemic classes holding only fields/getters/setters with no behavior of their own. Returns BLOCK/APPROVE plus a `Findings: <n>` count.
- `verifier-data-clumps` — reviews a diff for the same small group of variables/parameters recurring together across signatures or fields instead of being extracted into a class. Returns BLOCK/APPROVE plus a `Findings: <n>` count.
- `verifier-dead-code` — reviews a diff for variables/parameters/fields/methods/classes with zero remaining references. Returns BLOCK/APPROVE plus a `Findings: <n>` count.
- `verifier-divergent-change` — reviews a diff for a single class edited for many unrelated reasons in one change. Returns BLOCK/APPROVE plus a `Findings: <n>` count.
- `verifier-duplicate-code` — reviews a diff for two or more near-identical code fragments that should be shared instead of copy-pasted. Returns BLOCK/APPROVE plus a `Findings: <n>` count.

**Data enrichment** — pulls external knowledge in:

- `graphify-windows` — builds and queries a persistent knowledge graph from a codebase — god nodes, community detection, query/path/explain tools; Windows-compatible variant.

**Orchestration** — chains other skills or steps into a multi-step playbook:

- `audit-to-issues` — audits a repo on a chosen axis (over-engineering / illegal-states / pythonic) and turns each finding into a clean, reviewed, deduped issue — delegates to `ponytail-audit` and `to-issues`.
- `auto-commit` — groups a working tree's changes into cohesive Conventional-Commits, previews the plan, then commits each group.
- `deepen-module` — drives a deepening candidate from architecture review to settled, documented design.
- `done` — end-of-session wrapper: runs `/reflect`, prints summary, updates task state.
- `grill-with-docs` — stress-tests a plan against the domain model and updates documentation inline.
- `issues-to-prs` — implements each selected open issue as an independent, parallel git-worktree agent and ships exactly one PR per issue — disjointness-gated, no shared merge.
- `multi-agent-thermo-nuclear-review` — manual-only multi-agent fan-out of `thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review` — per configured lens, diverse finders + one adversarial verifier run in parallel, reconciled against the agent's own reading; delegates the rubric and size-pass to thermo-nuclear by path.
- `prototype` — builds a throwaway prototype to flesh out a design; routes between two branches.
- `tdd` — test-driven development with red-green-refactor loop.
- `to-issues` — breaks a plan/PRD into tracer-bullet issues, gates with `verify-issue-breakdown` before publish.
- `ubiquitous-language-doc` — generates/refreshes a CONTEXT.md Ubiquitous-Language glossary derived from the code, wires it into CLAUDE.md, and quality-gates it by reviewing the glossary as source code.
- `validate-fix-loop` — dispatches the quality validators listed in `config.json` (default: 8 general validators plus the 23 `verifier-<smell>` code-smell checks) in parallel each iteration, then routes each validator's findings — via `config.json`'s `fixer_map` — to its own `fixer-<smell>` skill where one is mapped, or batches unmapped validators' findings into one `apply-validator-findings` call, running fixer dispatches sequentially; repeats until every validator reports zero findings, total findings plateau across an iteration, or `max_iterations` is hit.

When editing this repo you are almost always authoring or refining a skill, so the conventions below *are* the architecture.

## SKILL.md anatomy

YAML frontmatter then a markdown body:

```text
---
name: kebab-case-name        # must match the directory name
description: <what it does>. Use when <trigger phrases>.
arguments: <optional>        # declare inputs passed at invocation time
---

# Title
<body: process, rules, report format>
```

The `description` follows a fixed two-part pattern: a statement of what the skill does, then a `Use when …` clause listing the trigger phrases that should fire it. The harness matches on this, so it carries real weight — write it for dispatch, not just documentation.

A skill may bundle supporting files (the skill-meta skills all reuse one `scripts/inventory.py` for their inventory step — see the shared-script note below; `build-verifier` also bundles an `assets/` template it reads and fills):

- `scripts/` — deterministic logic the skill runs as code instead of re-deriving in prose.
- `assets/` — boilerplate/templates the skill reads and fills.
- `config.json` — values set once and read, rather than re-entered each run.

**Shared scripts.** When several skills need the same deterministic step, the script has one home under `skills/_shared/` and each skill's `scripts/<name>` is a *relative symlink* to it — one source of truth instead of N drifting copies. `inventory.py` works this way (used by `skill-audit`, `skill-tune-up`, `verifier-audit`, `build-verifier`, `propose-skills`). Edit `skills/_shared/inventory.py`, never a symlink. `_shared/` has no `SKILL.md`, so `skill-linker` and `sync-skill-index` ignore it; the symlinks resolve at each skill's real location, so they keep working through the `.claude/skills/` skill symlinks too.

## The design contract enforced by the existing skills

These two vocabularies are the standard any new skill here is expected to meet — `skill-audit` checks the first, `skill-tune-up` the second. Apply them when writing a skill, not just when auditing one.

**Four buckets (from `skill-audit`)** — every skill should fit *cleanly into exactly one*:

1. **Utility** — one small reusable thing, the same way every time.
2. **Verification** — checks the quality of a final output.
3. **Data enrichment** — pulls external data *in*.
4. **Orchestration** — chains other skills into a multi-step playbook (coordinating many steps is its single job — this is not "straddling").

A skill spanning 2+ buckets confuses the harness about when to fire it; split it or trim it.

**Five structural levers (from `skill-tune-up`)** — prefer these over spelling things out in prose:

1. Deterministic logic → a bundled `scripts/` script.
2. Templated output → `assets/`.
3. Re-entered or hard-coded config → `config.json`.
4. Fixed-option setup questions → the `AskUserQuestion` tool.
5. Invocation-time inputs (slug, path, target) → an `arguments` frontmatter field.

## House style for skill bodies

These skills share a structure worth matching in new ones: a short framing, an explicit numbered **Process**, and a **Report format** with literal markdown tables. Reports are blunt and skip anything already fine ("don't pad the report"), and end with the single highest-value action.
